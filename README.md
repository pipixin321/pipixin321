#### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Huaxin Zhang
I am a Master of HUST (Huazhong University of Science and Technology), supervised by Nong Sang.

ðŸ”­ **Reseach-wise, I mainly focus on**:
- Multi-modal Large Language Models
- Video Understanding, more specifically, Weakly-supervised Temporal Action Localization (WSTAL) & Weakly-suervised Video Anomaly Detection (WSVAD).


ðŸ˜„ **I am open to**:

- A internship/job offer with computer vision/multimodal LLM research and engineering.

ðŸ“« **Contact me by**:

- Email: zhanghuaxin@hust.edu.cn

ðŸ’¬ **News**:
  - 2024-07-01: We release our code and model of "Holmes-VAD: Towards Unbiased and Explainable Video Anomaly Detection via Multi-modal LLM".[[project page](https://holmesvad.github.io/)]
  - 2024-06-10: We release our code and model of "Arcana: Improving Multi-modal Large Language Model through Boosting Vision Capabilities".[[project page](https://arcana-project-page.github.io/)]
  - 2024-01-29: I start my internship in Baidu VIS, to do some research on Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM).
  - 2023-12-09: One paper about point supervised temporal action localization is accepted on AAAI 2024.
